            Hey everyone! My name is Andrew, and I'm a high schooler who loves to bake. Any type of cake, cookie, pastry, you name it, I'm always down to 
            try out. I love baking so much because it's so calming. I can blast my favorite music, make my favorite dessert, and relax with it on a nice
            weekend afternoon. I also love baking because I have a huge sweet tooth. Anything sweet I'll eat: candy, juice, and of course any type of pastry.
            It's always a great activity to do with friends as well. There's nothing more fun that having a huge baking day with a bunch of friends and 
            going crazy with a bunch of new recipes and ideas. Sugar cookies are a great choice when baking for or with a group of people. This is because
            everybody can frost and customize their own cookies to take home with them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Speaking of my favorite dessert, you may have noticed the picture of cinnamon rolls at the top of my website. Well, this is because I 
            <strong>love</strong> cinnamon rolls! When they're warm, gooey, and covered in sweet vanilla frosting, nothing beats it. If I could start and 
            end my day with any food, it would probably be cinnamon rolls.

        <h2 style="font-family: Georgia; color:saddlebrown">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough whisk together the warm milk, sugar, and melted butter in a large bowl. 
                The mixture should be slightly warm, not hot.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk and butter mixture. Stir and allow it to rest for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 4 cups of flour to the milk mixture and stir together until just combined.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and rest it rise for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Butter or grease 2 9-inch round baking pans and set aside.</li>
            <li>To make the filling mix together the brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic wrap/towel from the dough and add the other cup of flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir well, 
                then turn out onto a clean surface like a kitchen counter.
            </li>
            <li>Knead the dough for at least 10 minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Be careful not to add too much flour. The dough should be
                wet but should not stick to your hands or your surface. The dough should be smooth and spring back when poked once you've kneaded enough.
            </li>
            <li>Roll the dough out into a large rectangle, about 1/2 inch thick. Fix the corners with a spatula to make sure they're sharp and even.</li>
            <li>Spread the cinnamon filling out evenly over the dough.</li>
            <li>Starting from one end, roll up the dough into a log and pinch the seam closed. Place the seam side of the roll down facing your surface.</li>
            <li>Using a large kitchen knife, cut the log into evenly pieces, about 1 1/2 inches thick. Place the cinnamon rolls in the prepared pans, with 
                1 in the center and the other 5 surrounding it (almost like a star). Cover the pans with a towel and let proof for at least 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Farhenheit.</li>
            <li>After the rolls are done proofing, bake them for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Once the rolls are out of the oven, let them cool for at least 10 minutes before spreading any frosting/glaze over them.</li>
            <li>If wanted, add some store bought vanilla frosting over a warm roll. Enjoy!</li>
